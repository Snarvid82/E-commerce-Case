# Case Study: **Analyzing an E-commerce Database**

We will apply the SQL ideas we learnt on Day 1 to a useful, real-world problem in this case study. We will examine data from an online store that offers a variety of goods in a number of categories. 
The company keeps track of its products and customer orders in a database.

In this case study, our objective is to extract and analyze the data to provide answers to important business questions, such as determining the top-selling products,
comprehending how well each product category is performing in terms of sales, finding high-value clients, and so forth.

Products and orders are the two main tables in the database. 
The products table includes details about each product, such as the product ID, name, category, and price. 
Order ID, product ID, customer ID, quantity, and order date are among the details concerning client orders that are included in the orders table.

We'll utilize SQL queries to investigate the data, spot trends, and derive insights throughout the case study so that the firm can make wise decisions. 
This will enable you to practice the SQL concepts we discussed on Day 1 and will provide you a practical grasp of how SQL is utilized in a commercial context.
